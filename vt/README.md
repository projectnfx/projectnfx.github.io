# VidTorrent
The clientside portion of a project that allows users of the site to torrent movies remotely and then recieve a link to the movie once it has downloaded. The serverside can also be found on here labeled **XVTServer**

## Inspiration
I don't know where the inspiration for this project came from but esentially, I saw this project as something cool that I could actually seeing myself use as I did normally torrent things back in the day and I would watch movies on my TV (Connecting the PC to the TV).

## How it works
1. Search for a movie (JSON file containing movies & their respected piratebay link located locally on server)
2. Click on the movie to set it as the desired download.
3. Input your email (The email that you want the movie link to be sent to.)
4. Press Download!
5. Check your email in a few minutes for a link subjected as 'Movie Downloaded!'
  1. If the movie has already been downloaded, you will get an email instantly.
6. Press the link and enjoy your movie :)!
